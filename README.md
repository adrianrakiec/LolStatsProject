# LolStats üéÆ

This project is my first encounter with Angular, developed during my month-long internship under the supervision of a mentor. It's a web application that allows users to check their rank in the game League of Legends and view their last 5 games. To create it, I used [Riot Api](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis).

## Installing and Runnin üñ•Ô∏è

1. Clone this repository:  `https://github.com/adrianrakiec/LolStatsProject.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd LolStatsProject`
3. In `riot-api.service.ts` add your api key from Riot
4. Download dependencies using: `npm i`
5. Run the program: `ng serve --open`

## Summary
During this project, I embarked on a journey to learn Angular from scratch. Here's a brief overview of my progress:
* Starting from Zero: I began with little to no knowledge of Angular and gradually immersed myself in the framework.
* Utilizing HTTP Client: I learned how to make HTTP requests using Angular's built-in HTTP Client module, enabling communication with external APIs.
* Implementing Auth Guard: I gained experience in implementing authentication guards to restrict access to certain routes based on the user's authentication status, enhancing the security of the application.
* Understanding Angular Application Architecture: Throughout the project, I delved into the fundamental architecture of Angular applications, including components, services, modules, and routing.
* Learning Git Best Practices: I familiarized myself with Git version control and adopted best practices for collaboration, including branching strategies, commit conventions, and pull request workflows.
* Engaging in Code Reviews: I actively participated in code reviews. This process helped me improve my code quality, understand common pitfalls, and learn from others' approaches.
  
This project served as an invaluable learning experience, allowing me to gradually build my skills in Angular development, software engineering best practices, and collaborative teamwork.
